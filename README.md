# Crossmatching
A key technique in Data Driven Astronomy 

When investigating astronomical objects, like **active galactic nuclei (AGN)**, astronomers compare data about those objects from different telescopes at different wavelengths. This requires positional cross-matching to find the closest counterpart within a given radius on the sky.

## DataSet
- [AT20G Bright Source Sample (BSS) catalogue] {http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/Cat?J/MNRAS/384/775} : 320 objects, listing the brightest sources from the AT20G radio survey
- [SuperCOSMOS all-sky galaxy catalogue.] {http://ssa.roe.ac.uk/allSky} : 240 million objects, listing galaxies observed by visible light surveys

## Equitorial Coordinate system
Positions of stars and galaxies is usually recorded in either [equitorial] {http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/E/Equatorial+Coordinate+System} or [Galactic] {https://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/N/North+Galactic+Pole} coordinates.

A point on the celestial sphere is given by two coordinates:
- **Right ascension**: The angle from the vernal equinox to the point, going East along celestial equator;
- **Declination**: The angle from the celestial equator to the point, going North (negative for South)
